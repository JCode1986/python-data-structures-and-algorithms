## Challenge
* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
    * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
    * Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
    * Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
    * Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
    * Define a method called isEmpty that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
    * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
    * Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
    * Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
    * Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
    * Define a method called isEmpty that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
* `push` method - O(1)
* `pop` method - O(1)
* `peek` method - O(1)
* `is_empty` medthod - O(1)
* `enqueue` - O(n)
* `dequeue` - O(1)
* `peek` - O(1)
* `is_empty` - O(1)

## API
* `Class Node` - with value and next attributes
* `Class Stack` - top attribute
    * `push(value)` - push node on top of stack
    * `pop()` - pop top off of stack
    * `peek()` - return value of top of stack
    * `is_empty()` - returns boolean if stack is empty
* `Class Queue` - front attribute
    * `enqueue(value)` - adds node to queue
    * `dequeue()` - removes first node that was enqueued
    * `peek()` - return value of front of queue
    * `is_empty()` - returns boolean if queue is empty
